# Snackbar_Utility version 1

Utility class to extend Snackbar class.

I will not introducec Snackbar class in this article.

1. Basic functionality of Snackbar class.
   
2. Display snackbar again after dispearing (With Snackbar class, it should dispear after triggering the action.).
   I achieve it by making a Snackbar class then display.

4. Count the click times (or exactly said, count the time of display Snackbar).
